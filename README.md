# MLDiabetesRisk
Using machine learning to predict diabetes risk factors in connection with class imbalances

HiCounselor provides a platform for students to complete projects in data science and software engineering. This was a free project that I chose in order to familiarize myself better with the work of machine learning scientists.

The project is concerned with predicting the likelihood of a patient having diabetes after observing several feature variables on this patient. The dataset used contains just over 50,000 rows of information with 22 columns for each observation. The project includes data preprocessing, data cleaning, model building, and the use of test data to train the model. 

A virtual environment is provided by HiCounselor and in addition to that, I have decided to share my code for the project for learning purposes. I'm happy to receive any feedback.
